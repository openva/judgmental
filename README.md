# Judgmental

Pops up an API and a website for judicial opinions for a given court.

## Use

Provided with a list of URLs of PDF-based court opinions, this extracts text from those legal opinions, performs natural language processing on that text, creates a JSON-based API and bulk downloads of those decisions, indexes them within a search system, and pops up a website to search, browse, download, and analyze those decisions.
